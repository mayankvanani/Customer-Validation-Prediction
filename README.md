# Customer-Validation-Prediction

## Summary
 - Dataset contains various customers' credentials for past 6 months. Out of the customers bank wishes to find which of his customers are      more likely to leave. So using Deep learning techniques of implementation and optimisation, model has been designed.
 - Used **Grid Search** Algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters.
